                        promotes learning to ensure the well-being and growth of its students. With the curriculum of joining 
                        rigorous academic standards with active learning experiences, students are stimulated to pursue their 
                        interests and develop a range of competencies that will help them in their lifetime. SGD fosters critical

                        citizens. Hence, with a commitment towards individualized support, each student can thrive and reach his full
