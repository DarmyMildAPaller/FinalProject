                    <h3>Philippines Returns to Traditional June-to-March School Calendar Starting June 2025</h3>
                    <p>The Philippines Department of Education announced that starting June 16, 2025, public schools will 
                        return to the traditional June-to-March academic calendar. This change aims to address challenges 
                        caused by extreme heat during summer months, which previously disrupted classes. The new schedule 
                        includes 197 class days and allows private schools to set their own start dates within the legal 
                        timeframe. This shift marks a significant step toward stabilizing the school year and improving 
                        learning conditions nationwide.
